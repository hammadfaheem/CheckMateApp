## 🧰 Getting Started

> Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CheckMateApp-main.git
cd CheckMateApp-main
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
